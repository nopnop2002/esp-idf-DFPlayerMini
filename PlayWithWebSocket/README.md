This project uses [this](https://github.com/Molorius/esp32-websocket) component.   
This component can communicate directly with the browser.   
This is a very nice component.   

I used the CSS and HTML files [here](https://www.webdesignleaves.com/pr/jquery/js-audio-player.html) as reference.   
This is a Japanese site.

# How to use
Open a browser and enter the ESP32 IP address in the address bar.   
You can use ```esp32-server.local``` instead of the IP address.
